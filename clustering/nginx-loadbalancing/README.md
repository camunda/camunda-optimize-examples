# Camunda Optimize Load Balancer Example nginx

This example demonstrates how you can run multiple instances of the Optimize Backend in parallel and use a load balancer like nginx to route the requests dynamically.

The most important part from the Optimize perspective of this example are the different environment-config.yaml files:
 - [one for the Optimize instance that is importing data from our engine](./environment-config-importer.yaml)
 - [one for the Optimize instances that are not importing data but just serving requests](./environment-config.yaml)

[./optimize/sso-keycloak-example-plugin/](./optimize/sso-keycloak-example-plugin/)
To find out more about the Optimize SSO Plugin mechanism, find the docs [here](https://docs.camunda.org/optimize/latest/technical-guide/plugins/single-sign-on/)

It includes a docker-compose with:
1. Camunda Optimize: 3 instances (1 importing, 2 not importing but serving requests)
2. ElasticSearch
3. Camunda BPM
4. Load Balancer (nginx)
